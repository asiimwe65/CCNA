UTP-unshilded Twisted Pair used in ethernet networks
Ethernet standards are defined in IEEE(in other words protocols and technologies)

.                               UTP CABLES
 NOTE:   we use straight through cables when we are connecting that are not the same and cross over cables when you are connecting
devices that are the same.

Examples of devices and their connecting points(pins or ports)
             receive                     transmit
PC            3&6                         1&2
FIREWALL      3&6                         1&2
ROUTER        3&6                         1&2
SWITCH        1&2                         3&6

Auto-MDIX feature is a modern one that is used to detect data and enable switching for receiving and transmitting of data.
(1000BASE-T AND 10GBASE-T)- these cables are bi-directional (can receive and transmit data)

.                             FIBER CABLES
The fiber glass core : To send and receive data
The cladding core    : To reflect light
The outer jacket     : To protect the cable

<   
the fiber cables send and transmit data in this format
>
 The fiber cables are in multimode and singlemode.  The multimode has a wider glass core than the singlemode.
 The singlemode allows connection to further distances than the multimode.
