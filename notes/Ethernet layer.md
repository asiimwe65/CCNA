Ethernet operates in the data link layer and the physical layer. It is a family of networking technologies defined in the IEEE 802.2 and 802.3 standards. Ethernet supports data bandwidths of the following:

10 Mbps
100 Mbps
1000 Mbps (1 Gbps)
10,000 Mbps (10 Gbps)
40,000 Mbps (40 Gbps)
100,000 Mbps (100 Gbps)

Ethernet is defined by data link layer and physical layer protocols.
Ethernet uses the data link subayers as well.

ny frame less than 64 bytes in length is considered a “collision fragment” or “runt frame” and is automatically discarded by receiving stations. Frames with more than 1500 bytes of data are considered “jumbo” or “baby giant frames”.

If the size of a transmitted frame is less than the minimum, or greater than the maximum, the receiving device drops the frame. Dropped frames are likely to be the result of collisions or other unwanted signals. They are considered invalid. Jumbo frames are usually supported by most Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet switches and NICs.
