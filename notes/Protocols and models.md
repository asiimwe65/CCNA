Protocols must account for the following requirements to successfully deliver a message that is understood by the receiver:

An identified sender and receiver
Common language and grammar
Speed and timing of delivery
Confirmation or acknowledgment requirements


Common computer protocols include the following requirements:

Message encoding
Message formatting and encapsulation
Message size
Message timing
Message delivery options

 Encoding is the process of converting information into another acceptable form, for transmission. Decoding reverses this process to interpret the information

 When a message is sent from source to destination, it must use a specific format or structure. Message formats depend on the type of message and the channel that is used to deliver the message.

  when a long message is sent from one host to another over a network, it is necessary to break the message into smaller pieces

  Message timing is also very important in network communications. Message timing includes the following:

Flow Control - This is the process of managing the rate of data transmission. Flow control defines how much information can be sent and the speed at which it can be delivered. For example, if one person speaks too quickly, it may be difficult for the receiver to hear and understand the message. In network communication, there are network protocols used by the source and destination devices to negotiate and manage the flow of information.
Response Timeout - If a person asks a question and does not hear a response within an acceptable amount of time, the person assumes that no answer is coming and reacts accordingly. The person may repeat the question or instead, may go on with the conversation. Hosts on the network use network protocols that specify how long to wait for responses and what action to take if a response timeout occurs.
Access method - This determines when someone can send a message. Click Play in the figure to see an animation of two people talking at the same time, then a "collision of information" occurs, and it is necessary for the two to back off and start again. Likewise, when a device wants to transmit on a wireless LAN, it is necessary for the WLAN network interface card (NIC) to determine whether the wireless medium is available.
The animation shows a woman and a man speaking at the same time. The woman says What time is the movie? and the man says When are we meeting for dinner?. Because they spoke simultaneously, neither understood the other and they both say Sorry? I did not understand you.


Network

Network communications has similar delivery options to communicate. As shown in the figure, there three types of data communications include:

Unicast - Information is being transmitted to a single end device.
Multicast - Information is being transmitted to a one or more end devices.
Broadcast - Information is being transmitted to all end devices.


Network communication protocols are responsible for a variety of functions necessary for network communications between end devices. For example, in the figure how does the computer send a message, across several network devices, to the server?

functions include addressing flow control, sequencing,reliability and interface plus error detection
