IPv4 addresses begin as binary, a series of only 1s and 0s. These are difficult to manage, so network administrators must convert them to decimal. This topic shows you a few ways to do this.

Binary is a numbering system that consists of the digits 0 and 1 called bits. In contrast, the decimal numbering system consists of 10 digits consisting of the digits 0 - 9
Each address consists of a string of 32 bits, divided into four sections called octets. Each octet contains 8 bits (or 1 byte) separated with a dot.
For ease of use by people, IPv4 addresses are commonly expressed in dotted decimal notation.
