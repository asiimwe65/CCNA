🚦 What is the Transport Layer?
The Transport Layer (Layer 4 in OSI / Transport in TCP/IP) acts as a “traffic manager” between applications on different devices.

✅ It makes sure data from different apps doesn’t get mixed up.
✅ It breaks large data into smaller pieces (segments) and reassembles them at the destination.
✅ It chooses the right transport protocol (TCP or UDP) for the application.

📌 Example:
Your PC can run a browser, email client, and video chat at the same time. The Transport Layer keeps their data separate.

📦 Transport Layer Protocols: TCP vs UDP
There are two protocols at the transport layer:

Feature	TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)	UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Connection	Connection-oriented (3-way handshake)	Connectionless (no handshake)
Reliability	Reliable: ensures all data arrives	Unreliable: no guarantee of delivery
Acknowledgments	Yes (ACKs sent for received data)	No ACKs
Resends Lost Data?	Yes	No
Ordering	Keeps data in correct order	May arrive out of order
Speed	Slower (more overhead)	Faster (less overhead)
Use Case Examples	Web (HTTP/HTTPS), Email (SMTP/IMAP), FTP	VoIP, Video Streaming, DNS lookups

📑 Responsibilities of the Transport Layer
Responsibility	Meaning
Tracks Conversations	Separates data from multiple apps (browser, email, video calls).
Segmentation/Reassembly	Splits big data into segments; reassembles them at the destination.
Adds Header Info	Includes port numbers to know which app data belongs to.
Multiplexing	Allows multiple apps to share the same network connection at the same time.

📦 TCP in Detail
🔒 Reliable and connection-oriented

3-way handshake to set up a session:

SYN (Hello, I want to talk)

SYN-ACK (OK, let’s talk)

ACK (Great, start sending)

📦 Breaks data into segments
📦 Tracks sequence numbers → ensures correct ordering.
📦 Resends lost segments if no ACK received.

📌 Think of TCP like sending a registered parcel:
✔️ You get tracking numbers.
✔️ If lost, it’s resent.
✔️ You’re notified when it arrives.

🏆 Apps that use TCP
HTTP/HTTPS (web browsing)

Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)

File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

Secure Shell (SSH)

📦 UDP in Detail
⚡ Fast and connectionless

No setup, no handshake.

No ACKs, no retransmissions.

Best-effort delivery → Send and forget.

📌 Think of UDP like sending a postcard:
✔️ No one tells you if it arrived.
✔️ Faster because there’s no tracking.

🏆 Apps that use UDP
VoIP (voice calls)

Live Video Streaming (Zoom, YouTube Live)

DNS (quick lookups)

TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)

🏁 Why Choose TCP or UDP?
Requirement	Protocol	Why?
Must be reliable	TCP	All data must arrive correctly.
Can tolerate some data loss	UDP	Faster, no retransmissions.
Delay-sensitive (real-time apps)	UDP	Retransmissions cause lag.
Critical data (banking, email)	TCP	No missing or corrupt data.

📖 Memory Trick
“TCP is Reliable Post Office, UDP is Fast Pizza”

TCP = Tracks, Confirms, Protects.

UDP = Untracked, Delivered Quickly, Probably
